# N8N-project
1. Project Overview
Problem:
Managing internal SOPs, HR onboarding documents, and internal customer support manually is inefficient. Employees struggle to find the right documents, leading to wasted time and productivity loss.
Solution:
An AI-driven automation agent built using N8N, OpenAI, Slack, Pinecone, and Google Drive. This system automates document retrieval, onboarding assistance, and internal knowledge management. Employees can simply ask a Slack bot for SOPs or internal guides, and the agent fetches the relevant information.
Impact / Results:
‚úÖ Instant document retrieval via Slack.
‚úÖ Reduced manual effort in HR & internal support.
‚úÖ AI-powered responses improve accuracy.
‚úÖ Seamless integration with existing tools.
