# N8N-project_ HR & Internal Document Agent
<br>
Project Overview
<br>
Problem:
<br>
Managing internal SOPs, HR onboarding documents, and internal customer support manually is inefficient. Employees struggle to find the right documents, leading to wasted time and productivity loss.
Solution:
<br>

Employees can simply ask a Slack bot for SOPs or internal guides, and the agent fetches the relevant information.
Impact / Results:
<br>
‚úÖ Instant document retrieval via Slack.
<br>
‚úÖ Reduced manual effort in HR & internal support.
